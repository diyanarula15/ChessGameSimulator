# Chess Game Simulator

**Chess Game Simulator** is a Python application that reads PGN (Portable Game Notation) files to visualize chess games move by move. This project highlights the famous **World Chess Championship 2010** match, showcasing each move on an interactive board with detailed analysis.

## Features

- **PGN File Parsing**:
  - Processes standard PGN files to extract game data (players, moves, results, etc.).
- **Move-by-Move Visualization**:
  - Animates the progression of the game on a digital chessboard.
- **SVG Board Rendering**:
  - Displays high-quality, scalable chessboard graphics for each move.
- **Game Result Analysis**:
  - Automatically identifies the winner or highlights a draw.
- **Player Identification**:
  - Displays information about the players involved in the match.

## How It Works

1. The program reads a PGN file containing the chess game's details.
2. It extracts key information:
   - Player names
   - Moves
   - Result (win, loss, or draw)
3. Visualizes the game on a chessboard, move by move, with SVG rendering for clarity.
